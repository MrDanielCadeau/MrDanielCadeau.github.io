        text: "Welcome, I'm glad to see you here! My name is Daniel Cadeau, I'm a 21 years old WEB developer, specialized in LARAVEL. I have a clear preference for the back-end development, but of course I like visually beautiful websites, so I care about front part too. I also  I have been passionate about the world of code since a very young age, I made my first HTML/CSS website when I was 11, a little project focused on Zelda video game. During school period I had lost for a while this passion for the benefit of other subjects, but now I am fully involved in web development for over 2 years. Firstly I trained myself as an autodidact, after what I joined Web@cadémie course by Epitech Paris. And now I continue my adventure in the code with a work-study program in a company. I'm not open for any proposal now, but feel free to add me on LinkedIn, I will be glad to count you among my connections.",
